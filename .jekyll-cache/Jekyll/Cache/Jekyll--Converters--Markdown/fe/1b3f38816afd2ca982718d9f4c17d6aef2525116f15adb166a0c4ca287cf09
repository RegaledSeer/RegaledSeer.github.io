I"¡<p>Hello! My name is Kevin and I am a hopeful computer science student who aims
 to maintain a blog on this website! This took a lot of work to set up 
properly (even if it was meant to be ‚Äúplug and play‚Äù), but thankfully it has 
finally been set up correctly!</p>

<p>I hope to use this website as both a means of publishing some of my thoughts on 
software engineering, as well as some CTF writeups that I may end up doing in 
the future!</p>
