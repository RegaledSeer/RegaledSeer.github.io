title: An Internship Journey, part one.
---

Ah, fall semester. For many college students, it's the start of another
semester filled with anxiety and stress, but for Northeastern students, it's
not only the stress and struggles of maintaining good grades, but also the
very scary reality of job hunting.

At Northeastern University, we have our very ambitious "Co-Op" program. This
is our flagship career-building program for our students and universally
influences every husky on or off campus because of how big the program is.
For readers who aren't from Northeastern, our co-op program is essentially
6 months of actual work at companies who have participated in the program.
Thanks to Northeastern's networking, most companies who have participated in
the program have allocated secured position for Northeastern students, in 
exchange for the security that the students they get (after being interviewed,
of course) are more or less very strong candidates for the position.

At Northeastern, co-op is a big part of our lives. Northeastern likes to say
that all students end up getting some sort of co-op during their semesters,
and that is mostly truth; however, there is definitely a minority that cannot
find a co-op that they enjoy within the timespan of the semester and they have
to take classes going into the next semester, which is definitely a very real
threat to most students (even though it shouldn't be; we have a pretty good
percentage of people who get co-ops).

As you may have guessed, this post is about my first co-op (this semester), and
the struggles I went through to ultimately end up with 2 amazing opportunities.
This semester was definitely one full of pitfalls, struggles, and surprises,
but I am incredibly thankful to Northeastern's co-op program for allowing me
to fall flat on my face when I was a sophomore, and not when I am seeking 
full time positions. I honestly think that the co-op program was definitely
the best fit for me, and I would have a hard time trying to adjust to "normal"
college life in other schools, but that's a story for another time.

I went into this first co-op season with an absurd amount of determination and
motivation. For most first co-ops, they do not have any sort of internship or
work experience related to CS (remember, most of these students are fresh out
of high school with only a year of CS experience, so it's pretty intimidating
to start applying). That wasn't the case for me: I had already had a freshman
internship thanks to the folks over at MITRE (which, by the way, is a great
company to work at), so I was pretty confident in my ability to score some
great interviews and possibly secure some awesome offers.

I went all-out when I was applying for internships. Following the footsteps of
my mentor, I made a spreadsheet detailing just about everything I need to know
from each company application I sent out: When I applied, the status of my
applications, any notes about the companies I should know about, and any 
remaining thoughts I had after applying and/or interviewing with them.
For me, this wasn't necessarily overkill, but it was a splendid way for me to
keep track of all of the information necessary, so that I knew exactly what I
applied to and so that I wouldn't also find myself surprised when an email
arrives from a company I couldn't remember that I applied to.

One thing that separated me from most first coops, though, was my personal
endeavor to also seek a summer internship position as well: Most first coops
have a hard time finding a co-op position in general, but I went into the
game fully expecting to not only land a co-op position, but to also secure
 a summer internship position as well. Doing so would not only bolster my
experience, but would also feel incredibly rewarding, as I would have secured
a position outside of my school's network, meaning that I would have achieved
it all by myself.

I started applying in the summer, around August. Figuring that I had nothing
to lose in applying to some big shot companies, I started applying to companies
like Google and Dropbox. Within a week, I started getting companies responding
to me, which was incredibly exciting. After all, who wouldn't be excited if 
the first company that reached out to them was *Google*? Little did I know,
most tech companies are very eager to seek candidates out for code samples and
interviews, but getting the interview was in fact the easiest part of the 
process...
