title: An Internship Journey, part two.
---

When I last left off on my journey, I was lucky enough to get an interview
with big companies like Google. Ultimately, however, each individual 
company I interviewed with had it's own unique feel to it, so it's really
hard to accurately portray each company in chronological order. For this
post, I have decided to split up every experience I had with each company
separately and essentially describe them on their own.

I'd like to warn you that that this part of the post is entirely composed of
my failures. I applied to over 100 companies, and of those companies, only
13 of them were interested enough in even sending some coding sample over to
me and most of them rejected me even then. This post is a recap of that
experience and should definitely be taken with a grain of salt, since you
may have a better/worse time than I did.

## Google
### Started roughly around mid-August. Rejected mid-October.

Google was by far the most humbling interview I've had thus far. It was 
actually the first company I applied to, and the one I initially had the least
expectations for. After all, who wouldn't want to work at Google for their 
first internship / co-op? I was excited to see that three companies had
more or less reached out to me in the same time frame (i.e. Google, Dropbox,
and Slack), and I was excited by the prospect of working here.

Google first sent out a coding sample for me to do, which was actually kind
of tricky. Later on I would go online to discover that one of the challenges
was similar to an NP complete problem, which was both expected of Google and
also very humourous, but there were a few pseudo-polynomial and approximate
solutions to the problem which worked out.

I sent in the coding sample and waited roughly a week before they came back
with some good news. I got passed the coding sample, and now all I had to
do was pass two technical interviews! It was a pleasant surprise, being that
it was my first coding sample and that it was with Google, but nevertheless I
tried to push off Google as far back as I could to get as much practice as I 
could before I had to do it (although in reality I didn't practice nearly as
much as I'd like).

After around 2-3 weeks and the school semester kicking in, I finally had the
two technical interviews. Google's process requires that I pass two techincal
interviews in order to make it past the hiring committee, so there was a lot of
stress going into it.

The first interview was definitely the hardest one of the bunch. Not only was
it a challenging question, but it was also my first real technical interview!
I can't disclose the details of the problem, but I definitely had the right
intuition about the problem itself. The problem was, though, I was not nearly
prepared enough to solve the problem appropriately: My execution and
implementation was atrocious, but my intuition with the problem was fine.
Granted, I had a little trouble initially trying to understand the problem, and
my interviewer didn't do the best job of explaining it, but I was eventually
able to get to a point where I understood everything. Ultimately, though, I was
discouraged after that first interview.

The second interview was a much more rewarding experience. I felt a bit more
confident after that interview and definitely felt like I could have done well
had I not suffered through that first interview. Ultimately, however, I think
this interview was the one that let me progress to the third interview.

For Google interviews, the process is generally two phone interviews, and then
they'll decide whether or not they want to move you onto host matching. However,
I think through a combination of being both inexperienced at interviewing and
potential, Google's hiring committee felt that they didn't have enough information
to reject me on the spot, which led to my third interview.

My third interview was roughly two weeks after my two phone interviews. 
The question was complex enough for me to have a little bit of a hard 
time to solve it, but I did reasonably well in my opinion. 
After the phone call, I felt pretty good about the interview, and this 
ultimately served to my misfortune when I got the email stating that I was 
not going to be moving forward at the time. I was really down at the time 
because I felt as though I was so close to making my dream coop happen, but 
in hindsight I can see why I was rejected, as I definitely was not performing 
to what they expected of me.

Google's interviews were definitely the first interviews to really bring me to 
reality and forced me to start preparing for other interviews straight away,
 as I felt as if I wasn't ready to interview with the Big 4 just yet.

## Dropbox
### Started roughly around mid-August. Rejected mid-August.

To be honest, I didn't get very far with Dropbox. A recruiter reached out to me
and they sent me a coding sample from Hackerrank, but I wasn't able to 
complete it in the expected time. It was a really cool graph problem that
got me thinking a lot about graphs afterwards, but I wasn't able to solve 
it, and was rejected shortly after.

## Slack
### Started roughly around mid-August. Rejected mid-August, and also late October.

Slack was an interesting one. A recruiter reached out to me and said that I 
could take a coding sample, which I had taken Google's coding sample 
recently, so I figured it would be worth my while to try it out. 
However, I took their coding sample immediately after Dropbox's coding 
sample, and I quickly realized that back to back interviews was *extremely* 
taxing. I didn't do well on the coding sample, and thus I was promptly
rejected afterwards.

However, by some stroke of luck, Slack had revised their hiring process and
sent  emails out to rejected candidates around October, stating that there was
a new processand that candidates could retake the coding sample. I took the 
coding sample and was able to ace all of the questions this time around 
(by October, I had accrued a decent amount of technical interview 
experience), and was able to move past the coding sample. From there, I 
had a phone screen with one of the recruiters, who had passed my information
to the teams. I don't know if it was a cultural fit or that the teams were
not interested in my skills, but I was ultimately unable to move past 
this particular stage, which was a bit unfortunate.

## Facebook
### Started late September, rejected early October

I went to a Facebook event over at my school, and was able to meet 
one of the recruiters for my region. After the event, I asked if I could 
send him my resume, to which he agreed, and then we started the interviewing
 process.

I didn't get very far (a pretty common trend in my first year of interviews),
 and I had really started to choke on the first phone interview. I couldn't
solve the problem at all and I just didn't understand what my interviewer
was trying to hint (although maybe I would've been able to solve it now, who
knows?). Ultimately, I didn't do well enough to move onto the second stage
of phone interviewing, so I was rejected promptly afterwards.

## Hudson River Trading
### Started mid-October, rejected mid-October

This was a short but gruelling one. I was contacted by a recruiter and asked
to do a coding sample in C++, which at the time I had no reference to C++ in 
my resume whatsoever. I figured that they were interested in my candidacy no
matter my background, so I gave it a shot.

The coding sample started off pretty easy, but then I got into a problem which
took quite a while to solve, and I realized that I had really taken for granted
that I was able to interview in Python in almost every company. Having no 
experience in C++, I didn't quite know what to expect when I tried debugging my
code for the coding sample, but ultimately I wasn't able to produce a working
algorithm and was shortly rejected afterwards.

## AmazonRobotics
### Started late October, rejected late October.

This one was really weird. I didn't apply for a SWE position, but rather a 
software test engineer, which was more akin to IT than it was SWE, but I 
realized that midway through the interview, and wasn't able to put my whole
heart through the process. I quickly realized that the stuff I would be doing
there wasn't to my liking, so I wasn't very passionate about the interview.
I did manage to impress one of my interviewers regarding my background, but
I never heard back from them, so presumably I was rejected.

## MongoDB
### Started late October, rejected late October.

This was quite possibly the quickest rejection I've had post-interview. I had
a phone screen with a recruiter who realized that I just really didn't know 
what MongoDB was (as embarrassing as it was, I realized that you should 
**really** study the companies you apply to). We had a decent chat about the
product, and she said she would send my resume over to the engineers, but I
strongly suspect that it was my incompetency in that phone screen that lead
to a rejection. It did end up giving me a hard lesson in researching companies
before you apply to them, so it wasn't all for nothing!

## Summary

Overall, I think the rejections definitely stung, but they were an important
part of the process as they did help me prepare for the interviews which
actually did land me offers (I'll cover that in part three). The interviewing
process was definitely eye-opening and helped me realized that even if I had
prepared extensively throughout the summer, I still needed to have some actual
interviewing experience to really feel the pressure and learn if I could 
perform under stress.

I wouldn't say that I enjoyed these interviews (I don't think many people would
say that they truly enjoy interviewing with all of the associated stress), but
I can say I definitely learned a lot about algorithms and designing, which
have also indirectly helped me in my courses, as I was taking algorithms this 
semester as well.

Stay tuned to see my experiences with companies that did provide an offer!
