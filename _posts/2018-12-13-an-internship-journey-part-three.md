title: An Internship Journey, part three.
---

This is part three of my sophomore year co-op/internship experience. Last time
was a bit depressing with the amount of rejections I got, and that didn't even
cover all of the rejections I got from recruiter screening (e.g. not even
landing interviews). Including the companies that I interviewed with, only
23 companies bothered to send me a rejection email, and the rest of the 
companies just ignored me (for the record, I had around 64 internship applications,
and about 40 co-op applications). It was definitely not a fun time to be 
applying, but I'm grateful for the four offers that I actually had this time
around.

## SnapApp
### Started around early October, given offer mid-October, turned down mid-October

SnapApp is a startup located in Boston that focuses on selling products to 
marketers. In terms of interesting content, a lot of marketers from other
companies want interactive content or some other medium to attract customers,
and SnapApp builds its products with this in mind. I applied to SnapApp through
the Northeastern Co-op network, and expected, I was applying to be a co-op for
six months at the company.

My first experience with SnapApp was a 30 minute phone screen with the
recruiter. It kicked off very well, and hilariously enough, there was a fire
drill that rang extremely loudly at the end of the interview, which was 
humourous for both me and the recruiter. That didn't necessarily cause any
issues, though, as a few days afterwards, my recruiter told me that the team 
would like an onsite interview with me!

Heading to their office, I was impressed by the location of the office, and 
also how conveniently located it was from my school (it was around a 20 minute
walk from my apartment, so it would have been an amazing commute time). The 
total time for the interviews was around 2 hours, with 4 30-minute long 
interviews that were primarily geared towards behavioral questions and my
resume. The position itself was a DevOps Co-op position, and they were 
interested in me because of my freshman internship experience with MITRE, in 
which I had extensively used Ansible for an automation project I was working 
on. I had 4 interviews, each of which generally covered largely behavioral
questions, although my experience with Ansible was testedby the lead DevOps
engineer. I had a good time with the interviewers and I definitely did feel
like I made a strong impression with the interviewers.

A few days after the interview (around Monday at this time), I got some 
good news from the team: I got an offer! I was very glad at the time 
because I didn't know if I would get any future opportunities, but I decided 
to remain calm and chose not to accept the offer on the spot. I was still 
waiting for feedback from Intuit, whose interview was supposed to be next 
week Friday, but SnapApp would only get me until next Monday to decide. 
I was pretty stressed out throughout the week because I didn't know if I wanted
to just play it safe and accept the offer, or to chance it and try applying to 
Intuit and hoping I get in there instead. Ultimately, I decided I was more 
interested in a software engineering position rather than a DevOps position, so
I had to turn SnapApp down. This was a bit concerning at the time as I was 
taking a huge risk of turning down an offer for a better promise. However,
that is the risk in trying to pursue your dreams! I discussed this with my
co-op advisor and we agreed that since I felt so strongly about my ambitions,
I would likely not enjoy working too long at SnapApp if I felt that better 
opportunities were on the horizon. I'm very grateful for the opportunity that
SnapApp gave me, and if in the future they have a software engineering position
open, I would definitely consider applying again!

## Citrix
### Started around late October, given offer late-November, turned down early-December 

I had an interesting experience with Citrix. I applied to Citrix with the
intent of joining them as a summer intern, so this was completely out of the
Northeastern Co-op program (although they do hire co-ops! If you're a
Northeastern student, I recommend applying! They do some great work). This was
actually the first of the two Karat interviews I had this season. Karat is an
interesting company: Some companies like to have a filtering company like Karat
first interview candidates before passing them onto the company for further
interviewing. In this case, Citrix had decided to reach out to me with a Karat
engineer first.

The Karat interview was interesting. It was just like a typical technical 
interview, but with the premise that all of this footage was going to be sent
to Citrix engineers to review. I did pretty well on the first question, but
I utterly choked on the second question and spent over ten minutes blabbering
about what I thought I could approach the solution with. I was pretty dejected
when it was over, and I thought that would've been the end of the process then.

Strangely enough, I was invited back for another round of interviews! It just
goes to show you that even though you thought you may have done very poorly
on an interview, there's always a chance that you did pretty well. Our own bias
can't really save us when trying to objectively judge how well we did. 

The next and final set of interviews was a series of 50 minute long interviews,
and there were four of them, effectively taking up 4 hours of my day when I
was interviewing. These were all video screen recordings as well, so there 
wasn't much I could do in terms of presenting myself well other than wearing
a dress shirt. With some determination and hope, I went into the interview 
pretty eager to succeed.

The interviews composed of two technical interviews, and two behavioral
interviews. Oddly enough, the first interview was a technical interview,
followed by two behavioral interviews, and closed up with a technical
interview. It was a bit disconcerting to see how the interviews lined up, and
I probably would have preferred to have the technical interviews first to
get them out of the way. It's just my personal preference, but I find it less
stressful during the behavioral interviews if I know that all of the 
technical interviews have been completed.

The first of my technical interviews was by far my favorite technical interview
of this entire season. My interviewer started me off by having me share my 
screen and we worked with a simple concept. He asked me a few questions and
saw how I coded them up, and when I mentioned that I'm pretty confident with
functional programming, we immediately switched gears into functional
programming in Python. The questions were definitely very challenging, and
they were even more rewarding to do because Northeastern actually taught us
functional programming in our introductory course (If you aren't aware of
that, I would recommend reading my post regarding our introductory CS courses).
In the end, this was the only technical interview were I was disappointed with
not being able to finish all the questions because they were so interesting!
Both the interviewer and I felt that we had a great time discussing the problem
and I would have loved to do another problem, but unfortunately 50 minutes
can only get you so far.

My second and third interviews were largely behavioral, and they were focused
on gauging my interest in the company and also had me asking tons of questions
about the company. I was pretty interested to learn more about Citrix products,
and my curiosity was satisfied at the end of each of them.

My fourth and final interview was the second technical interview. As expected,
they asked me to design a program. At this time, I was an Object Oriented 
Design Teaching Assistant, so I was pretty comfortable with designing a program
that could be used in production. I was able to demonstrate my comfort in being
able to use the MVC pattern and also extends classes to avoid code duplication,
as well as consider the pros and cons of using inheritance in my program. This
last interview left me feeling pretty satisfied as a whole, so I was looking
forward to an offer in the upcoming weeks.

Within a week after my interview, I was contacted by my Citrix recruiter, who
had announced that I was selected to receive an offer! I was glad to hear this,
but my recruiter and I had timing conflicts to the point where the date in 
which she mentioned that I had received an offer and the actual delivery of the
offer letter itself was separated by two weeks (funnily enough, 
having an interview around Thanksgiving seems to upset usual business
 operations). In that time, something else happened that was very interesting, 
so I ultimately decided to decline the offer. Nevertheless, I am super grateful
to Citrix for giving such a wonderful interviewing experience, and I would love
to try my best against another functional programming interview!

## Intuit
### Started around late October, given offer late-November, accepted late-November

Intuit's an interesting company to work with. Lots of people know about their
products, but it seems that the average layman isn't familiar with their name.
If you aren't sure about what Intuit is, they are best known for their products
TurboTax, Mint, and Quickbooks (so you should probably recognize one of these
by now). Here at Northeastern, there's a certain level of "prestiege" that is
associated with an Intuit coop, as it is possibly one of the best co-ops you
can land within the Northeastern network. You'll hear people talk about Intuit
co-ops like they're the real deal (and they are!), so it's definitely a strong
presence to have on your resume.

I had applied to Intuit through the co-op program, and as expected of the co-op
program, if you get an offer, you will be working the company for the full 6
months of the program, and you will effectively serve as a full time engineer
for that 6 months. Around late October, an Intuit recruiter reached out to me
and said my resume was interesting enough to warrant a coding sample to start
the interview process. I had known good things about Intuit by that time, so I
was delighted to hear that my background was deemed sufficient to be
interviewing with Intuit.

The coding sample itself was pretty similar to some of the challenges that I
did with other companies, so I was pretty happy with the end result of my
coding sample. Within a week, I was then contacted by my recruiter to say
that I had passed the coding sample, and that I will now be scheduling a Karat
interview to see if I can make it to the final stage. Having already done a
previous Karat interview which I felt I had bombed at the time, I was a bit
nervous at first, but steadied myself in order to do well on this interview.

I had mixed feelings about the Karat interview, my interviewer this time around
was much more interactive with me, and we definitely went through two problems
pretty easily, but when I got stuck on the final problem, I had only been able
to communicate my understanding of how to solve it to the interviewer, but I
wasn't able to solve the problem itself. My interviewer had assured me that
she understood exactly what I was attempting to describe a solution for, and
that given a couple more minutes I probably would have been able to debug
my solution to produce a working one, so she mentioned that it wouldn't be
too much of an issue. However, being the skeptic, I wasn't sure if I would make
it past the Karat interview. Fortunately, I got good news within a week saying
that I had passed the Karat interview, and that I will now have one final 
75-minute long interview with two Intuit engineers!

During my final interview, I was asked both behavioral and technical questions.
I actually had to showcase a project of mine to the engineers as well, and they
had asked about the design and technical details of the project, to which I 
happily and promptly gave responses to. After the behavioral interview and
project showcase was done, I went on to the technical interview, which was
more of a design problem with a focus on algorithmic complexity. Having 
recently worked with graphs on a side project of mine, I was able to design
the program efficiently and effectively by using my understanding of graph
theory, which must have impressed the interviewers. I left the interview
feeling pretty good about myself, so I was hoping for some good news within
the week.

Within that week, I had gotten the good news! Intuit had decided to submit an
offer letter to me, and I was absolutely thrilled! Getting Intuit as my first
co-op was a major success and helped me verify that my hard work was getting
me places! I was beyond thrilled to get an Intuit co-op, so I had just about
signed the offer letter when it was given to me the next day. I'm thankful
for all that Intuit had given me, and I'm ready to be working with them in the
winter!

However, there is just just one more company that gave me an offer, and I was
beyond stoked to see that I was able to fit both companies in, which brings me
to my final offer...

## Microsoft
### Started early November, offered early December, accepted early December

Microsoft was the last of the "Big Four" companies that gave me a shot at 
interviewing with. I was in the midst of other interviews when the recruiter
had first reached out to me, so while I was thrilled to see Microsoft
interviewing me, I was under the mud trying to survive the other interviews
(most of which ended up rejecting me). When I first got an interview with
Microsoft, they had sent me to the Cambridge office for a mere 30 minutes,
but I was quite terrified of what was supposed to happen!

It turns out that everything was alright in the end, though. Microsoft had
just decided that since I was nearby, I could come onsite for a 30 minute phone 
screen to see if I was a good fit in terms of culture. My interviewer happened
to be from Northeastern (Go Huskies!), so it was really awesome to talk about
school-specific events and classes. I had a great time talking to my 
interviewer and she had mentioned that I would be a good fit for the Garage
program here in Cambridge. I wasn't entirely sure what the Garage program
was, but I didn't mind, so I just accepted the application for the Garage
program.

About three days later, I got an email saying that my interviewer liked me
well enough to get past the screening (traditionally, it is also done as a
phone screen, but being in Boston has some perks), so they wanted me in for
one final interview session. I was excited, but I also knew that this was
my last opportunity for one more interview until I had to decided whether
or not I wanted to join Citrix for the summer.

When I arrived at Microsoft, there were about 12 other candidates who were
from all sorts of places! I met two Masters students from Brown, three students
from MIT (granted, MIT is literally down the block from the Cambridge office),
and two students from UIUC! It was great talking to all of them, especially
since there were brief stints in time between our interviews to talk about
how they went and just small talk in general.

The actual interview sessions consisted of a 10 minute project demonstration,
followed by 4 45 minute long interview sessions with each interviewer from
the project demonstration. I was actually the first of the candidates to get
selected for project demonstrations, and along the way, the interviewers 
had mentioned that it was their first time doing interviews in this 
particular style. A quick aside: When I plugged in my laptop into my HDMI,
my Linux OS had some issues with external displays, so I almost had a 
heart attack regarding how to present my project. Luckily, I had the foresight
to check to see that everything was updated on my Windows dual boot, so I just
loaded from Windows instead. Another aside: The garage interviews work slightly
differently from the traditional interviews over at Redmond, so I can't 
say for sure that any other interview experience was the same as mine.

The first interview consisted of a design question: I had to design a program
using an interface and list out the methods that I would suggest for the
interface. My interviewer and I had been discussing my resume and my background
for some interesting experience, and he saw that I had been an Object Oriented
Design Teaching Assistant, so naturally he wanted to test my aptitude for 
being able to design good programs that aren't overengineered but cover
all the bases for a suitable program. For the most part, I had designed well
enough to cover everything, but there was one thing that I missed, which
ultimately was just a small oversight on my design that probably would be 
discovered as I developed the application, but sometimes that not enough,
so I need to have a bit more experience with designing before I can readily
say that I can design an interface with the expectations of others!

The second interview was a classic technical interview with a technical
problem to solve and I had to use algorithms to solve the problem. I can't
really go too much in detail regarding the actual problem, but it was
definitely a rewarding one to solve: I had seen a similar problem when I was
interviewing with Google, and fortunately Google's problem was more complicated
than this question, so it was a walk in the park for me! I wouldn't say that
the question was any *easier* if you didn't know how to approach the problem,
but thanks to my stubborn mentality when it comes to interview questions, I
would always think about the problem after an interview and see if I could do
better, and this actually helped me solve the interview question for Microsoft!

The third interview was by and large a curveball. I can't tell you the exact 
question, but Microsoft decided to ask me a networks question despite the fact
that I had not listed Networks on my resume, and that I had never taken a 
networking course in my life. However, I did do some self-studying purely for 
the fact that I wanted to learn more about networks, so I was able to come up
with a solution and explanation for the problem, which presumably satisfied my
interviewer. It was definitely an oddball question, as I had came onsite with
full expectations of having 4 technical interviews based on design and 
algorithms, but this was definitely a pleasant surprise!

The final interview was another algorithmic challenge that I had to solve. This
one was probably the easiest one to solve, as I had literally came up with a 
solution to the problem within seconds of the interviewer asking. Once I had
asked for all the edge cases, I wrote down two solutions: A more simple
solution based on sorting and another solution taking a space-time tradeoff.
I guess my interviewer felt as though I had seen the problem before, so he
asked a followup question, and I had immediately recognized that this was
probably a reduction of the problem to my original algorithm. Having seen
that it was a reduction, I reused my previous algorithm to show the interviewer
how I could reduce his new twist to the original problem, and then reduce the
output back to a solution for the original problem. Needless to say, I was 
very happy that I had saved the easiest interview for last, as any of the
previous interviews probably would have stressed me out if they were my last
interview.

After the four interviews, everyone got back together and were pretty anxious
about the results. Our coordinator said that Microsoft would try to reach out
to us within a week to let us know if we had been selected for an offer. I was
pretty happy about that day, since I was able to meet a bunch of cool people,
but my biggest regret was not being able to stay in touch with them, as they
could have been really cool people to talk to afterwards.

For about a week, I was pretty anxious about my candidacy for Microsoft. I felt
pretty good about the interview, but I didn't know if I had made all the
correct moves and had showcased enough of my skills to impress the
interviewers, so I looked through my email everyday. Finally, on the day after
Thanksgiving, while waiting in line at a random Macys' store in New Hampshire,
I got an email with the header: "Congratulations!". Having read the email, I 
was ecstatic! I would be going to Microsoft!

Microsoft also almost gave me a heart attack when I had told them I had 
previously signed with Intuit and would like a slightly shorter internship,
but having worked out an agreement to reduce my coop by one week, I was able
fit Microsoft with the full 12 week internship starting on June 24. With this
in mind, my interview season this year was over, and I am super happy to be
working with both Intuit and Microsoft next year!

## Conclusion

This interview season was definitely a gauntlet. I had applied to over 100 
companies, and I had experienced some big disappointments and some very 
upsetting moments during my interviews. I realized that I was extremely 
thankful for my hard work over the past 2 years, as having a freshman
internship was huge for improving my resume and making it past some HR filters,
and I'm very thankful for the hard work that I had to go through in freshman
year to get an internship with MITRE, as the folks over at MITRE were very 
helpful and willing to help me improve. Needless to say, this year's interview
season was definitely a struggle, but I had been able to push beyond my 
struggle and land some amazing opportunities! I'm hoping to do some great work
out there!

As a last note, if you're a student whose stressed about co-ops or internships,
all I have to say is: Keep going. The interview season is vicious as a lot of
your chances for even getting an interview are up to chance, and while some of
the interview process itself can be controlled by you, it's very upsetting to 
see your hard work produce nothing because there were external factors that
affected your candidacy. Don't expect to be working at a specific company, but
if you keep your door open for other companies, you may find that an
opportunity just as good as your original goal may be just around the corner.
