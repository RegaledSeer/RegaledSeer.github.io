- Talk about how you learned to separate yourself from your code: Your code may not be always 100% the right thing to do, and criticism towards the code is not criticism towards you, the person
- Design is a very important thing in SWE, and thinking about the big picture is also super useful. Thinking about the systems and how they interact is super important for bigger
 projects, and is vital to the successful of the product
- Use case of your tools are also very important: You don't want to build useless things that end up not being productive towards the end goal
- Maintain an opinion, even if it's wrong. Don't be so flimsy that you would bend your back at the first signs of adversity. However, be prepared to be corrected, as sometimes people have better ideas
- Ask QUESTIONS! Most important question. Don't be afraid of looking stupid, because asking questions lets you get more context. Who would seek to discredit the engineer who asked a bunch of questions, but got a critical feature delivered?
- Seriously, if you don't get it, just ask again. Looking like a fool doesn't mean crap if you get that product in, but if you don't ask any questions and you don't deliver,
 you'll get eyebrows raised
- Know who to talk to: Some people give great ideas, but often poor approaches on how to do it. Recognize that one person's opinion on how to solve something might sound great on paper, but is really just a hack
- Figure out what the problem really is about: Sometimes the problem is a lot simpler than what was initially given: You could be asked to engineer something that is substantially easier than what you initially thought it to be based on the vague description of the task.
- Strive for right design and nothing less. Good design reduces tech debt and leaves less in your mind for cognitive complexity
- But not to the point where it breaks you: If there really is no solid design, you have to think about whether or not the trade off is worth it, and then "design and document" :)
- Don't stress out over work.
