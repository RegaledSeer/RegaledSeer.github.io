title: Welcome to my website!

My name is Kevin, and I am an aspiring second year Computer Science student at Northeastern University. My main interests are in both software engineering and computer security. I hope to combine these two disciplines and one day work as a Security Engineer.

On this website, I hope to include links to some of my projects, as well as maintain a small blog detailing some of my experiences with software engineering and computer security. 

## Side Projects

I generally spend my time working on research projects over at RIS3 Labs, but I happen to have a few side projects that I have worked on! Here's a few examples of projects that I have done whenever I want to kill some time after a big test.

### Northeastern Office Hour App

This is a project that is currently ongoing and will be released to the public once the faculty have approved the application and the product has been thoroughly tested. The idea behind this project is that CS students in my school generally populate the office hours (I happen to be both guilty of being on both sides) of TAs, and there is a generally just a whiteboard with names of students in the order that they should be handled. Using Django and MySQL, I am developing a small and lightweight application that works with Northeastern's servers to create a queuing system.

### PyBoardGames

This is an [ongoing project](https://github.com/RegaledSeer/PyBoardGames) that I happen to be working on whenver I'm on the train or just simply want to throw in some hours enjoying a breath of fresh air.

The idea behind this project is to reinforce my understanding of good Object Oriented Programming, while learning to apply OOP practices in dynamically typed languages instead of static languages like Java. It's been quite an interesting experience and I might blog some of my ideas and struggles when I've been working on the project!

### EtherGo

This was a [final project](https://github.com/RegaledSeer/EtherGo) that I did for my cryptocurrency seminar. A friend of mine and I decided for our final project that we should implement Go (the board game) in Ethereum for a proof of concept that we could create games and other applications using Solidity and Ethereum's smart contract system.
